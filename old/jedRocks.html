  	<p>Your glazed eyes stare out. The notes, you think, I can almost touch them...<br/>A few minutes later a small fly lands in your mouth. If you were aware, it buzzing against your uvula would be a choaking pressure.</p>
  	<p>Someone will find your body, years later. "Man, he looks totally blissed out," one will say. "Good way to go," the other will agree. Somewhere inside your dessicated brain, something will twitch. The voice is like something from a dream. <br/>"Goood way to go."</p>
