    <p>Your shaking form falls forwards through the hole, planted facefirst on the moist dirt. You feel the sun rise on your back. It warms you somehow further in than skin deep. A few layers of skin.</p>
    <p>The next day, you feel revitalized. You get to wondering what else could be in that warehouse. You certainly didn't take much time to explore...</p>
    <p>It would feel like pretty much the same if you just walked back into the building, patched up the wall, got all dehydrated again. There would certainly be interesting things to see.</p>
